# PlayerIdsPlugin
Clientside command to get another player's id (useful for votekicking/banning people with weird names)

## /listids
Lists every player online, along with their ids. This simplifies votekicking people with non-dvorak or hidden character names.
Useful for servers where an alternative to the banning command is used (e.g. /banid), so you can't use the /votekick hammer button.

## /getid
Get the id of a player based on the players' name (not particularly useful)
